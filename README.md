# VEINS-Samples

## Overview

This repository implements simulations using **OMNeT++ 5.6.2** and **Veins 5.2** framework for vehicular communications. It contains five simple scenarios that demonstrate various aspects of vehicular communication and networking.

## Scenarios

1. **Scenario 1: Periodic Vehicle Status Messaging**
   - **Description**: Vehicles send periodic messages containing their status, including speed, position, and ID, to nearby vehicles. The information is collected and stored in a `.csv` file for analysis.

2. **Scenario 2: Emergency Vehicle Management and Prioritization**
   - **Description**: This scenario focuses on the management and prioritization of emergency vehicles within the traffic system.

3. **Scenario 3: Traffic Congestion Management**
   - **Description**: Simulates traffic congestion scenarios and implements strategies for managing traffic flow.

4. **Scenario 4: Broadcasting Traffic Information through Roadside Units**
   - **Description**: Vehicles receive real-time traffic information broadcasted from roadside units (RSUs).

5. **Scenario 5: Switching from Control Channel to Service Channel**
   - **Description**: Demonstrates the process of switching from a control channel to a service channel for improved communication efficiency.
